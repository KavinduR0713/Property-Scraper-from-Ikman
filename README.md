# Property-Scraper-from-Ikman
The Ikman Property Scraper is a data science project designed to scrape property listings from Ikman.lk, a popular online marketplace in Sri Lanka, and translate the listings into English. This project leverages web scraping techniques, data translation, and data processing to create a structured dataset of real estate listings, which can be used for various analytical purposes.

## Features
- **Web Scraping:** Automated extraction of property listings from multiple pages on Ikman.lk.
- **Data Translation:** Translation of scraped data from Sinhala to English using Google Translate API.
- **Data Storage:** Exporting the processed data into an Excel file for further analysis.

## Code Explanation

### 1. Web Scraping with Selenium and BeautifulSoup
- The project uses Selenium, a powerful web automation tool, to navigate through the Ikman.lk website. Selenium runs in headless mode, meaning it operates without a graphical user interface, making the scraping process more efficient. BeautifulSoup, a Python library for parsing HTML and XML documents, is used to extract relevant data from the web pages.

### 2. Dynamic URL Handling and Data Collection
- The script dynamically constructs URLs for multiple pages based on user input and iterates through each page to collect data. The page_source method of Selenium is used to retrieve the HTML content of each page, which is then parsed by BeautifulSoup.

### 3. Data Translation
- The project uses the Google Translate API via the googletrans library to translate the text content of property listings from Sinhala to English. This step ensures that the data is accessible and understandable to a broader audience.

### 4. Data Storage

- After scraping and translating the data, it is stored in a structured format using Pandas, a powerful data manipulation library. The data is then exported to an Excel file, making it easy to use for further analysis and insights.

## Data Science Techniques

### Web Scraping
Web scraping is the process of automatically extracting information from websites. In this project, we use Selenium and BeautifulSoup to scrape property listings from Ikman.lk.

   ##### 1. Selenium:
   - Selenium is a web automation tool that allows us to programmatically control a web browser. It is particularly useful for interacting with dynamic web pages where content is generated by JavaScript.
   - In this project, Selenium is configured to run in headless mode, meaning it operates without displaying the browser GUI, which makes the scraping process faster and less resource-intensive.
   - The script uses Selenium to navigate through multiple pages of Ikman.lk, retrieve the HTML content, and wait for dynamic elements to load.

   ##### 2. BeautifulSoup:
   - BeautifulSoup is a Python library for parsing HTML and XML documents. It creates a parse tree from page source code that can be used to extract data.
   - In this project, BeautifulSoup parses the HTML content retrieved by Selenium and extracts specific elements containing property listing information.

### Translation
Translation is a key step to convert the scraped data from Sinhala to English, making it accessible to a wider audience. This project uses the Google Translate API through the googletrans library.

   ##### 1. Google Translate API:
   - The Google Translate API is a machine translation service that can translate text between numerous languages.
   - In this project, after scraping the data, we pass the text through the Google Translate API to translate it from Sinhala to English.
     
   ##### 2. Natural Language Processing (NLP):
   - Translation is an application of NLP, which involves analyzing and manipulating natural language text. By translating the text data, we are leveraging NLP techniques to transform the data into a more usable format.

### Data Processing
Data processing involves organizing and preparing the data for analysis. In this project, we use the Pandas library to handle the collected data.

   ##### 1. Pandas:
   - Pandas is a powerful data manipulation and analysis library for Python. It provides data structures like DataFrames that are ideal for handling structured data.
   - In this project, Pandas is used to create a DataFrame from the translated text data, making it easy to manipulate and analyze.

   ##### 2. Data Export:
   - After organizing the data into a DataFrame, it is exported to an Excel file. This step involves using Pandas' built-in functionality to save the DataFrame in a structured format that can be used for further analysis in tools like Excel or other data analysis software.
